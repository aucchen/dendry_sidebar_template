This template is built on [smwhr's dendry starter pack](https://github.com/smwhr/dendry-starter-pack), with the addition of an editable sidebar and stylesheet. Everything else is mostly the same.

One difference is that to change the game's title and author, you'll have to change line 6 of `out/html/index.html` and line 20 of `out/html/game.js`, as well as `source/info.dry`.

## Editing the sidebar

See `source/scenes/status.scene.dry` Everything in this scene will be displayed in the sidebar, and will be updated on every click.

## Editing the stylesheet and/or adding custom JS

See `out/html/game.css` and `out/html/game.js`.
